## Description

The User Registration and Authentication System allows users to register, log in, and manage their account information. It is built with Java, Spring Boot, and a relational database (MySQL or PostgreSQL).

Features
User Registration: Users can create an account with a unique username, email, and password. Validation is performed to ensure uniqueness and format correctness.

User Login: Users can authenticate themselves using their username/email and password. The system validates the provided credentials.

Account Management: Authenticated users can update their account information, including email and password. Passwords are hashed and salted for security.

Password Reset: Users can reset their password if they forget it. The system provides functionality for email verification during registration and password reset.

Database Integration: User information is stored in a relational database (MySQL or PostgreSQL).

Security: The system implements session management and protects against common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and XSS attacks.

Enhancements
Email Verification: During registration, the system sends an email verification link to the user for account activation.

OAuth Integration: Users have the option to log in using third-party authentication providers like OAuth.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): User permissions and access levels can be managed through RBAC.

Logging and Monitoring: The system logs and monitors activities to detect anomalies or suspicious behavior.

## Dependencies
The project utilizes the following dependencies:

Spring Boot Web: For creating RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests.

Spring Boot Data JPA: For database integration and data access.

Spring Boot Security: For user authentication and security features.

Hibernate Validator: For data validation and constraint checking.

BCrypt: For password hashing and salting.

JavaMail API (Optional): For sending emails during account verification and password reset.

OAuth Library (Optional): For integrating with third-party authentication providers.

## How to Run
Prerequisites:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher installed on your system.
MySQL or PostgreSQL database installed and configured.
Database Configuration:

Create a new database in your preferred relational database management system (MySQL or PostgreSQL).
Update the application.properties file in the Spring Boot project with the appropriate database settings (e.g., URL, username, password).
Email Configuration (Optional):

If you want to enable email verification and password reset functionalities, configure the email properties in the application.properties file.
OAuth Integration (Optional):

If you want to integrate with third-party authentication providers like OAuth, configure the OAuth settings in the application.properties file.
Build and Run:

Open a terminal or command prompt in the root directory of the project.

Run the following command to build the project:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw clean package
After the build is successful, run the following command to start the Spring Boot application:

arduino
Copy code
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Access the Application:

Once the application is running, you can access it through your web browser or use tools like Postman to interact with the API endpoints.
